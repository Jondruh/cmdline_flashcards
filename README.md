* About This Project
A simple flashcard program that runs in the command line. It currently has a
rudimentary spaced repetition schedule and supports creating new cards and editing
cards as you are reviewing them.

I use this project for my personal study of flashcards and as an exercise in
applying what I'm learning as I study Ruby.

* How to Use
To use the flashcard program you need to create a 'cards' folder in
the directory in which you run 'flashcards.rb'. I've symlinked my cards folder
to where my flashcard.rb file is so that I can easily backup my cards folder.

The program only supports terminals that use the '$EDITOR' environment variable
as this what it uses to open an editor for card creation and editing.
